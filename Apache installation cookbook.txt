Creating the Index File:
cd ~/chef-repo/cookbooks
mkdir httpd/files
echo "Installed and Setup Using Chef" > httpd/files/index.html


execute 'httpd_firewall' do
  command '/usr/bin/firewall-cmd  --permanent --zone public --add-service http'
  ignore_failure true
end

execute 'reload_firewall' do
  command '/usr/bin/firewall-cmd --reload'
  ignore_failure true
end


If you send a request to your new webserver, you will get the welcome page whatever you put into the /var/www/html directory. This is due to the IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf statement at the end of the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file that instructs Apache 
to load the files finishing by *.conf located in the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory.

If you really want to display the content of the /var/www/html directory, you need to go to the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory and remove all the files there (you can also rename them but with an extension different from .conf).

Then, still in the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory, you can create a file (here mywebserver.conf) like below (the name doesnâ€™t matter, only the extension in .conf):

<Directory /var/www/html>
AllowOverride None
Require all granted
</Directory>
Now, every file created in the /var/www/html directory will be displayed by the webserver.
